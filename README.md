# Alumni Management System

**Repo:** https://github.com/dev-koushal/alumnimanagment

## Project Overview

Alumni Management System — track alumni, manage events, communication, whatever the hell you built this to do. Replace the vague crap with what your system actually does, who it helps, and why it matters.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: (e.g., Node.js + Express / Python + Flask / PHP + MySQL)
- **Frontend**: (e.g., React / Vue / plain HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL)
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Redis, etc. Use only what you're using—no generic buzzwords.

## Prerequisites

List exact versions and tools. Stop being fuzzy.

- Node.js vXX.X (use `nvm`—no excuses)
- MongoDB vX.X
- OR SQL: MySQL vX.X
- Any other dev tools you actually rely on.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-koushal/alumnimanagment.git
